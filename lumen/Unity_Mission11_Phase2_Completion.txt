UNITY BEYOND STARS – MISSION 11: PHASE II COMPLETION REPORT
------------------------------------------------------------

Cadet:        Aimana
Mission:      Echo Entity Contact
Phase:        II – Deep Echo & Triangulation
Date:         2298.05.17

------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:

Cadet Aimana successfully completed triangulation of three echo nodes.
Key coordinates mapped:
 - Node-A, Node-B, Node-C
 - Origin estimated at (12.7, -4.5, 8.9) with 92% confidence

Cadet analyzed amplitude logs, identified regular peak intervals (~75s),
and predicted next transmission at 285s.

Final command "TRANSMIT WHEN READY" was encoded and transmitted on 640 Hz channel.
