				<h3>Mission Summary</h3>
		    <h5>Cadet: Aimana</h5>
		    <h5>Mentor Droid: HIF‑Lumen (Unit 7)</h5>
				<p>I started the Orientation Trial by decoding the encrypted letter from Cadet Caesar. I understood that the core message was about the dangers of fatigue and human error, as illustrated by Technician Varo’s sleepless accusation.</p>
				<p>I located the deadly incident, Report ID 70, describing Cadet Nova’s fatal EVA simulation accident. I followed the investigation path through Alignment Gate A‑178 in the Zero‑G Sports Arena.</p>
				<p>In the Observation Dome, I completed the Stellar Identification Challenge, correctly identifying the relevant star patterns linked to Nova’s path.</p>
		    <p>I also explored the Nova II Cultural Exchange log, which showed how the crew processed the emotional impact of the incident and reinforced the importance of procedural discipline.</p>
		    <p>Finally, I asked Lumen if I had followed the correct narrative path, and received confirmation that I had fully completed the mission as intended. This trial taught me to pay attention to both technical and human factors during missions.</p>
		    <h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>During this Orientation Trial, I followed the true narrative path of the Caesar Protocol.</p>
		    <p>I understood that the message of the letter was about how small human errors, caused by fatigue and stress — like Varo’s sleepless accusation — can lead to larger tragedies, such as Nova’s fatal EVA incident.
</p>
		    <p>I correctly identified the deadly incident (Report 70) and followed the path through A‑178 and the Observation Dome challenge. I also interpreted teacherssite/hif/nova.html as a narrative clue about remembering and learning from mistakes.</p>
		    <p>Through the Nova II Cultural Exchange log, I saw how the crew processed this loss and reinforced the importance of discipline and care.</p>
		    <p>At the end, I asked Lumen if I had followed the correct path and received confirmation. This mission taught me to always respect both technology and human factors — as the Caesar Protocol reminds us.</p>
