UNITY BEYOND STARS – ANALYSIS REPORT – MISSION 11, PHASE II

Detected Peaks:
 - Peak 1 at 60s
 - Peak 2 at 130s
 - Peak 3 at 210s

Interval Analysis:
 - Interval 1–2: 70s
 - Interval 2–3: 80s
 - Average Interval: 75.0 seconds

Hypothesis:
The echo nodes may synchronize every ~75 seconds, possibly to exchange names, memories, or signal packets.

Recommended Action:
Continue monitoring at 75-second intervals for recurring activity.
Trigger message parsing at predicted peaks for optimal capture.
