    <h1>üìö Week 13 ‚Äì AI Tutor & Finding Your Creativity</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Personal Note</h2>
        <p>I originally started with an easier topic (password safety), but after some reflection‚Äîand teacher feedback‚ÄîI chose to explore a much deeper issue: how social media shapes our emotions, thoughts, and sense of self. The result was one of the most honest and eye-opening learning experiences I‚Äôve had this semester.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 1: AI Tutor</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> How Social Media Manipulates Our Thoughts and Emotions</p>
        <p><strong>Chat History:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683e74c3-a88c-8007-8f6d-8364e21df4e6" target="_blank">

        <h3>üß† Reflection</h3>
        <p>This conversation made me realize just how deeply social media impacts not only my attention but my emotions, identity, and sense of connection. It was uncomfortable to admit how much control the algorithm has over how I feel, but it also helped me see the small ways I can resist and reclaim that space. I don't want to be numb or shaped by something that doesn't know me. This reminded me that mindfulness and honesty‚Äîespecially with myself‚Äîmatter more than likes ever will.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="centered">üåê How Social Media Shapes Us ‚Äî A Deeper Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Attention as Currency</strong></li>
            <li>Social media platforms are designed to maximize your time and attention because that‚Äôs what generates profit through ads and data.</li>
            <li>To keep you engaged, algorithms prioritize emotionally charged content‚Äîespecially fear, anger, or envy‚Äîover balanced or neutral information.</li>

            <li><strong>2. Emotional Manipulation</strong></li>
            <li>Strong emotional triggers hijack your focus, altering your mood and mental state often without your awareness.</li>
            <li>Over time, this constant stimulation can lead to anxiety, distraction, and a loss of control over your own emotional landscape.</li>

            <li><strong>3. Distorted Self-Image</strong></li>
            <li>Repeated exposure to curated perfection causes self-doubt and comparison, making you question your worth and identity.</li>
            <li>You begin performing an idealized version of yourself online, drifting away from authenticity.</li>

            <li><strong>4. Surface-Level Connection</strong></li>
            <li>Real vulnerability becomes risky, so people play it safe‚Äîsharing what will be liked, not what is true.</li>
            <li>As a result, connection stays shallow and performative, leaving many people feeling isolated even while ‚Äúconnected.‚Äù</li>

            <li><strong>5. Cultural Impact</strong></li>
            <li>Social media encourages snap judgments and reduces empathy. People become profiles instead of full humans.</li>
            <li>Disagreements turn hostile, and compassion fades in a culture that punishes imperfection and rewards control.</li>

            <li><strong>6. The Way Back</strong></li>
            <li>Rebuilding real connection starts with intentional use: unfollowing toxic content, posting honestly, and setting firm boundaries.</li>
            <li>Resisting the algorithm means using social media on your terms‚Äînot letting it dictate your habits, identity, or values.</li>

            <li><strong>7. Hope for Change</strong></li>
            <li>If enough people choose honesty, restraint, and empathy, we could shift the tone of digital spaces.</li>
            <li>That ripple effect could lead to more human-centered platforms‚Äîand to more grounded, kind, and present lives offline.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Collaborative Planning Table:</strong>

        Open Google Sheets</a></p>
        <p>I carefully reviewed and completed the planning table based on my top 5 chosen activities. I made sure to revise the Creative and Critical Thinking columns according to the teacher‚Äôs feedback‚Äîremoving the mood board and ensuring that each idea reflects personal engagement and creative thought. The final version is ready and submitted via the shared Google Sheet.</p>
